//	The Singleton pattern is thus known because it restricts instantiation of a class to a single object
//	The Singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a class with a method that creates 
//	a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. 
//	In the event of an instance already existing, it simply returns a reference to that object.
// 	Usage:
// 		It is important to note the difference between a static instance of a class (object) and a Singleton: 
//		whilst a Singleton can be implemented as a static instance, it can also be constructed lazily, 
//		without the need for resources nor memory until this is actually needed.

//	This is a Singleton pattern with deferred instantiation
var mySingleton = (function(){
	var instance;
	//	constructor that houses all singleton properties & methods
	function initialize(){
		//	private properties & methods
		var myPrivateProp = "This is private variable!";
		function myPrivateMethod(){
			console.log("This is private method.");
		}
		//	public properties & methods
		return {
			publicProperty: "This is public property!",
			publicMethod: function(){
				console.log("This is public method.");
			}
		}
	}
	return {
		//	Static method
		getInstance: function(){
			if(!instance) {
				instance = initialize();
			}
			return instance;
		}
	}
})();

var singletonA = mySingleton;
var singletonB = mySingleton;
console.log(singletonA === singletonB);
